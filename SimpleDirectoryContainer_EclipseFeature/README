This is an Eclipse plugin that allows creating a dynamic Classpath Container that observes a folder 
and loads all .jar (or .zip etc) files into the classpath. This plugin is helpful to use a bunch of jar files in one folder as your classpath, without setting it manually.
We use it to get rid of the buggy IvyDE plugin for our IVY dependency management.

It is an evolution of original code I got from here:
	https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-eclipse-classpath/
Thus it originates from Aaron Tarter (aarontar@us.ibm.com).

The primary modification Ben Christensen made (besides renaming things to no longer say 'example') was making it handle
filenames that had multiple dots (such as com.company.library.name.v2.jar).

The improvements I made (Darko Palic) are to allow multiple directory containers in the classpaths and of course therefore in the eclipse launches.
The previous version had bigger issues about it.

The binary in downloads on GitHub just needs to be dropped into the eclipse /plugins/ folder and it will 
then allow adding a "Directory Container" library to the Java Build Path.

You can find the latest verion here:
https://github.com/dpalic/SimpleDirectoryContainer_EclipsePlugin/tree/master/ExportedPlugin

or directly (but maybe outdated):
https://github.com/dpalic/SimpleDirectoryContainer_EclipsePlugin/raw/master/ExportedPlugin/DirectoryClasspathContainer_1.1.2.jar

I created this jar by exporting a "Deployable plug-ins and fragments" from Eclipse at the project level.
